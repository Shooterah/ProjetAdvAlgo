# Knapsack Problem: Randomized Approach (Python)
# Author: Florian Doffemont

# Goal: Find a solution to the knapsack problem using a randomized approach.

# It means that we will generate a random solution and check if it is better than the best solution found so far. If it is, we will keep it. If not, we will discard it and generate a new one. We will repeat this process until we have found a solution that is better than the best solution found so far. 

# We will use the same data as the others algorithms.

# Import the necessary libraries
import random
import time

# Define the function that will generate a random solution
